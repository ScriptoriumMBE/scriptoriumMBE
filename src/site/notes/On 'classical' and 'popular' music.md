On this short piece of writing, I intend to explain what do the labels actually mean and briefly argue for a more precise terminology.

The terms 'classical' and 'popular' are evidently problematic. They are adjectives apt for individual pieces of music, not a tradition. The first movement of *Eine Kleine Nachtmusik* is much more popular than a fair bit of 'popular' music. And certainly the last albums by The Beatles have a much better case to be considered a classic than Luis Spohr's symphonies. All the proposed terms, like 'serious', 'commercial', 'art', and such are unsatisfactory, for they generalise without actually naming what makes both traditions different

And that is the important point. Both are musical traditions. Traditions that are passed from one generation to the other through specific means. Traditions that both have their classics, conventions, cliches, periods, styles.

"Classical music" is really music in the Western-Tradition-of-Written-Music It is possible to say that tradition properly started in the 11th century, when Guido D'Arezzo started to develop music notation. The instrumental means of the music have varied a lot in 1000 years, but one can broadly talk about four different categories: vocal, chamber, symphonic, solo and electronic/electroacoustic pieces. One can very clearly track the development and evolution of form and harmonic procedures through the centuries. Musicians who write in this tradition have a knowledge of it. Every single "classical" composer knows Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, etc. and has studied them. Every single "classical" composer knows western music notation. Most of them study in conservatoires. They compose music in a specific style, both influenced by the immediate musical *zeitgeist* and part of a bigger tradition.

On the other hand, "popular" music is another tradition, it comes from initially from the North American blues. One may call it western-American-oral-tradition of music. Obviously it is not isolated from the rest of music, it has been influenced by 'classical' music and by other music traditions. But it is clearly a separate, unique tradition. Most of the musicians that write in this tradition know about the classics (some examples include The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Queen, etc.). The way of studying this music is different, as it usually implies that the "student" learns songs by ear and starts to compose in a semi-selftaught manner. Formally, almost all of this music is based on the song format, but not all of it. Progressve rock has played a lot with form, Pink Floyd's "The Wall" which is more akin to a song cycle. Echoes is a long-form piece.

I think this is the best way to make sense of the differences of the two main musical traditions of the West.
