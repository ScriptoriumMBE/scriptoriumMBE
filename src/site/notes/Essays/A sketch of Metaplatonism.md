# A sketch of Metaplatonism

Assume an infinite-dimensional-abstract-space (this means that it is analogous but not identical to material or other kinds of spaces) that is constituted by all the possible mental objects (abstracted and *meta-abstracted* from actual mental objects). This includes things like statements (discreet thoughts, for example, all sets) and *qualia*, and combinations and abstractions of them. Note that this also includes statements which are not true and *qualia* that doesn't correspond to actual real-world experience.

All ideas, simple and complex, live inside this space (we will call it the Idea-space or the Metaplatonic space). It is called metaplatonic because it takes the Platonic theory of forms and abstracts it to devoid objects of unnecessary teleology and theologic and metaphysical assumptions.

The space is not limited by any means. It is not limited by existing *qualia* domains. It is not limited by logical constrains. This might seem completely unreasonable, but we are describing a model that includes logic inside of it, not a model that needs logic to be sustained.

The World of Wittgenstein (defined as constituted by all true facts) lives inside this space. That means that there is a sub-region of it that is bounded by a number of truth-statements: metaphysical (the ones that configure the physical —for example, matter, space, time—, they are not given by logic, but constrained by logic, and logic is also constrained by them), logical, mathematical, physical statements, and so on. The necessary-*versus*-contingent characterisations of a true-statement are a spectrum and not a binary division. The metaphysical truths are more necessary than the physical ones, but both are usually considered non-contingent. Fairy-tale, fantasy and fiction worlds all share some truth-layers, but not all of them, with our world. We call this layers context-layers. Then, a definition of truth is such "all the idea-objects that live in the space bound by with all the context-planes that accord with our reality", a sort of correspondence theory of truth.

It may seem impossible to state that any model works without assuming the rules of logic, as for *ex falso quodlibet*, it would seem that it couldn't possibly be described by language (as language assumes logic). But we must make a differentiation of looking at the model *from inside* Wittgenstein's world versus looking at the model just by itself. We note that there are usually two different ways of using language, the first one (ubiquitous in philosophy) is logical-semantic. We will use that one to look at the model from inside the world (and such everything outside the so-called necessary layers will be utterly meaningless). But to describe the model from the outside we effectively drop logic in a way, to adopt an all-encompassing language without negations, and not based on the traditional notions of formalised semantic but rather in pointing at abstract intuitions. 

The model has explanatory power in a number of areas of philosophy. Some of them will be detailed in the next paragraphs.

The model already solves the Russell Paradox (admittedly rejecting logic rules). The set of sets that do not contain itself is both contained in itself and not contained in itself. But this statement is not inside Wittgenstein's World, so to say, as it doesn't agree with the logical rule of excluded middle. This means that Naïve Set Theory exists comfortably inside the metaplatonic space, but not wholly inside Wittgenstein's World.



There are also some points of possible theological relevance. Aristotle defined of God as Pure Actuality. This space seems to be Pure Potentiality. This has some Leibnizian undertones.
Another interesting idea (not so much for the model in itself, but for the move of rejecting the absolute necessity of logic) is the question about where does logic come from as a worthwhile theological question. Assuming logic predates God is not satisfactory; this is another way of saying that the traditional definition of omnipotence is not satisfactory; this is a kind of *Eytyphron*'s dilemma, but for logic instead of ethics. In the same sense that an omnipotent creator-of-all God is outside Time, creates Time and then chooses to inhabits Time; so God is outside the bounds of logic, creates logic and then chooses to inhabit logic.

In the same way the laws of nature are useful to scientists and philosophers debate their ontological status, so might this model work (with the little caveat that here philosophers will both analyse its explanatory power and debate their ontology). We do note that the actual material world doesn't seem to allow for logical contradictions, which would render the metaplatonic space outside of actual material existence; this is self-evident. We make no claim on the actual ontological status of the metaplatonic space, that is left to metaphysical speculation. Maybe some philosophical pragmatist will allow this space to be thought of as existing.

We note that this is just a sketch (and currently it is in active progress), meant to give an idea of the model and its interests, and not a comprehensive overview.
