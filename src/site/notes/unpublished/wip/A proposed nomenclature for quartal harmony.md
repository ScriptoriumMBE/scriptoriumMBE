> [!Note] This is a work in progress, I still have to find a satisfactory way of cyphering some chords

Quartal chords are chords built by stacking fourths on top of one another. Just like common chords in tonal are built by stacking thirds. We will use the square □ and triangle △ symbols to symbolise each, respectively. We will proceed analogising the system of chord naming used for △-chords.

Fourths can be of different species. The ordinary species are perfect (or just) and augmented (the tritone). The fourth can also be diminished (enharmonic with a major third).

There are diatonic (following the so-called greek modes) and chromatic quartal chords. Our approach will name quartal chords by the mode in which they appear as the tonic chord. To indicate the amount of notes in a chord, we will use a superscript.

Quartal chords containing diminished fourths can sometimes not sound quartal at all (the easiest example is stacking two diminished fourths on top of each other, that is just a △-augmented-chord). Nevertheless, such chords can sometimes sound quartal, and those ones are included in the diagram below. The criterion for being included in the diagram has been more inclusive than not, the main reasons for exclusion were enharmonic octave equivalences and being clear △-harmony (or △-adjacent-harmony).



Here is the complete table of chords. P stands for perfect fourth and T for tritone.

The abbreviations are to be read like this:
J→Just (also might be symbolised by lcr and called Locrian, specially when it has more notes)
Ion→Ionian
Lyd→Lydian
Mix→Mixolydian
Dor→Dorian
Eol→Eolian
Phr→Phrygian;
the above can also be abbreviated with just the first letter.

oct₁→octatonic (also the second mode of limited transposition, the subscript indicates it is the one starting with a semitone)
m-→meta-
a-→altered (the subscript shows the altered note)
n-→normalised (the subscript shows the normalised note)
L-d→Lydian-dominant

A few interesting things: I discovered the meta-Lydian and meta-Ionian chords, which are also dodecaphonic tone-rows. I have used these chords in my pieces, like the [[Music/Partita para viola (2024-26)\|Partita for viola]]. They are built by alternating just and augmented fourths (just like the meta-Lydian-△-chord is built by alternating major and minor thirds).
